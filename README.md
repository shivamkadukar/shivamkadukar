# Hello, I'm Shivam! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am an experienced Data Engineer specializing in automated data sourcing and conversion, with a strong focus on optimizing data science and analytics workflows. Over the course of my 1.5-year career, I have developed a deep expertise in automating the extraction of data from diverse sources, including HTML, FTP, files, and emails. My primary goal is to transform this data into structured formats that are highly suitable for data science and analytics applications.

To achieve efficient data sourcing, I rely on a combination of Python, Selenium, BeatutifulSoup, and Requests, which have proven to be powerful tools. I have successfully extracted data from complex file types such as EBCDIC, COBOL, PDF, DBF, TIF, ACCDB, MDB, and XML. This diverse exposure has honed my adaptability and efficiency in handling various data formats.

In addition to automation, I possess extensive experience in data engineering and analysis. I have effectively utilized technologies like PySpark and Athena to tackle a range of scenarios and deliver optimal solutions. Through the optimization of data pipelines and the improvement of data quality, I have facilitated data-driven decision-making processes.

My passion for exploring innovative solutions and my strong analytical mindset have consistently driven me to solve complex data challenges. I thrive in collaborative environments, relishing the opportunity to work alongside multidisciplinary teams to propel data-related projects forward.

As a dedicated professional, I make it a priority to stay updated with the latest trends and advancements in the field of data engineering and analytics. My commitment lies in delivering high-quality results and contributing to the success of organizations by harnessing the power of data.
